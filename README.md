Conky Metro Clock Ext
=====================

Conky Metro Clock Ext is a rewrite of the Conky Metro Clock.
I decided to remake it to be closer to the version of WIndows 8.
I hope you will enjoy it.

My work is based on the [Conky Metro Clock](http://satya164.deviantart.com/ar\
t/Conky-Metro-Clock-245432929) by Satya164. Thanks to him.

==================

Improvement
-----------

* Wrote day of the week and month in a one line
* Reversed order between hour and date
* Switched to Noto Sans as default font
* Modified margin to clean the display

Date
----

I change the layout of the date to match the original clock of Windows.

Font
----

I found Noto Sans more relevent to mimic Sego UI than Open Sans Light. 

[Segoe UI](http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/family.aspx?FID=331) vs [Open Sans](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Open+Sans) vs [Noto Sans](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Noto+Sans) 

I like [Muli](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/muli) and [DejaVu](http://dejavu-fonts.org/wiki/Main_Page) too. Select your favorite !
