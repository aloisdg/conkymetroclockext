Conky Metro Clock Ext
=====================

Conky Metro Clock Ext is a rewrite of the Conky Metro Clock.
I decided to remake it to be closer to the version of Windows 8.
I hope you will enjoy it.

My work is based on the [Conky Metro Clock](http://satya164.deviantart.com/ar\
t/Conky-Metro-Clock-245432929) by [Satya164](http://satya164.deviantart.com/). Thanks to him.

Font
----

I found Noto Sans more relevent to mimic Sego UI than Open Sans Light. What do you think ?

[Segoe UI](http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/family.aspx?FID=331) vs [Open Sans](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Open+Sans) vs [Noto Sans](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Noto+Sans) 

I like [Muli](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/muli) and [DejaVu](http://dejavu-fonts.org/wiki/Main_Page) too. Select your favorite !

To display icon, I am using [FontAwesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) by [Dave Gandy](https://twitter.com/davegandy). I think to change to [SteadySets](http://dribbble.com/shots/929153-Steady-set-of-icons) by [Tommy SÃ¤hl](http://dribbble.com/tommysahl). I am missing Segoe UI Symbol ... Do you know any good alternative ? I did not find an equivalent in [icomoon.io](http://icomoon.io/).
